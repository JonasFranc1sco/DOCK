# DOCK  

## 📖 About the Project 
**DOCK** is a digital diary where you can record your days, thoughts and memories.
The unique feature is **time control**: you decide **when (or if) want to make public**.

It could be in 2 years... or in 20. The choice is yours. 
Each diary works like a small **"message in a bottle"**, launched into time - ready to be found and read in the future
